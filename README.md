Welcome to my analysis and visualization of publicly listed  🍕  ⛓️ &nbsp; in the United States. This will be ongoing and I will keep adding to this project when I have time.

~~Currently Papa John's is here, but shortly I shall be adding Domino's~~, as well as a comparison between the two.

I'm using [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/install) ♃ and work on a Debian 11 🐧 &nbsp; installed workstation.

I actually would ❤️ &nbsp;feedback. If you have anything to recommend criticize, or share, please contact me [here](https://vickrumahuja.com) or here through GitHub (if possible).
